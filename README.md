## Code names

<img align="left" width="100" src="https://github.com/sandorkakuk/Archi3/blob/master/WWF_Logo_Small_RGB_72dpi.jpg">

Thanks to our way of life, several animal species are threatened with extinction. I would like to pay tribute to these animals with the names of the versions. and alert people to the dangers.

Each release bears the name of an endangered species.
The background images for the editions are taken from the [WWF](https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/directory?direction=desc&sort=extinction_status) pages.
